I am an infectious disease epidemiologist and modeller with a strong interest in applying and developing statistical and mathematical models to understand the dynamics of infectious diseases through various data sources. My research focuses on developing and applying models (statistical and mathematical) to help inform public health policies and interventions aimed at controlling the spread of infectious diseases. I have been involved in multiple projects related to malaria, dengue, COVID-19, and diphtheria.\nI am currently a Research Fellow at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. I am also a member of MLGH-SG chapter (Machine Learning for Global Health, Singapore chapter).\nI did statistics for my undergraduate study at IPB University. For my graduate studies, I had an MSc in Epidemiology, an MRes in Biomedical Research, and a PhD in Epidemiology, Evolution, and Control of Infectious Diseases, all from Imperial College London.\nI co-initiated a community for Indonesian infectious disease modellers to share knowledge and collaborate called Indonesia Infectious Disease Modelling Community (INDEMIC).\nI am also a part of the early career researcher (ECR) committee for Infectious Disease Modelling conference 2024. This conference will be held on 6-8 November 2024 in Bangkok. If you are interested in attending or submitting your abstract, please follow this link: https://idmconference.net/\nI am also a guest editor for the special issue of Infectious Disease Modelling journal focused on advancing infectious disease modelling and its application to health policy in LMICs. Please follow this link if you are interested in submitting your work: https://www.keaipublishing.com/en/journals/infectious-disease-modelling/call-for-papers/advancing-infectious-disease-modelling-to-inform-health-decision-making-in-low-and-middle-income-countries/\nI always open for collaborations and talking about anything related to modelling in Indonesia context. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me. Thank you!"
